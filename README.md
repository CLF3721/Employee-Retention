# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification

## Description

Capstone Project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification course.

### Scenario:

* The Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm, Salifort Motors, wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company since it is so time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees.

### Problem Question:

* What is likely to make the employee leave the company?

### Task:

* Predict whether or not an employee will leave the company and provide data-driven suggestions for HR on how to increase employee retention.

### Solution:

* Analyze the data collected by the HR department, build predictive model to identify empoyees likely to quit, and identify factors that contribute to their leaving if possibile.
* Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Means

### Deliverables:

1. Executive summary that you would present to external stakeholders as the data professional in Salifort Motors; includes model evaluation, interpretation, data visualizations, ethical considerations, and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.
2. Completed python scripts.

### Dataset:

Raw: [Kaggle HR Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction): 14,999 rows (employees), 10 columns
